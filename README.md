## DecayEngine C++

DecayEngine is a proprietary engine developed using .NET Core 3.1 that works on Windows (Win32 and UWP), Linux, Android, XBox, PS4, and Switch.  
The engine was internally developed by [@bilenkonito](https://github.com/bilenkonito) between 2019 and 2020 for usage in Rust Racers. The project is no longer maintained as development on Rust Racers switched to Unreal Engine 5.  

This repository contains an unfinished rewrite of DecayEngine in C++ that begun in 2020 due to the .NET Foundation's decision to deprecate CoreRT.  
The original .NET version of DecayEngine can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/Nethash-AB/DecayEngine).  
Think of this repository as a museum piece.
